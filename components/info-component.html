<p class="center-text invert">
  Art inspired by nature and life, I first found my love for ceramics at 19 when
  I began pursuing an art I thought not accessible to me. Years later I studied
  in Florence, Italy learning sculpture, wheel throwing, and hand-building. My
  desire is to tell stories through my art and show that accessibility/beauty is
  for everyone.
